## Learning File Colocation
- It keeping all files related to a route or feature—UI, styles, logic, and tests—together in the same directory for better organization and maintainability.
- It say, we can add component in our route "i.e In file route, where we have page.tsx we can also add your compoment"

## Private Folder
- It's not added to routing system. It's is for internal stuff

## Route Group
- It allow to  logically organize our routes and project file without impacting the URL structure.
- Here, we simply create folder with "(folder_name)" and organize the related files.

## Layouts
- UI that is shared among multiple pages in your app.
- main Layout can't be deleted if we deleted it then when we do refresh it comes back again.
 
## Multiple Root Layouts
- We can use "Route Group" to apply multiple root layouts. It helps us to apply layout according to us.
