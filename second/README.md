## Meta Data
- It's used to set Title and describe the page. (export const metadata={})
- Both "page" and "layout" can have meta data but, "page" meta data is showen when they overlap.
- Meta Data can't work in client compoment. (So we need to make client componenet seperately and import it into the server side)
